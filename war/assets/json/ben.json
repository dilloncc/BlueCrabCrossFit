	"desc" : ["Ben is a Maryland native who started doing CrossFit his Freshman year at North Carolina State University. After a couple years of trying to do CrossFit on his own, he found his home at Raleigh's premier CrossFit gym, CrossFit Invoke, where he learned under CrossFit Headquarter Trainer, Christmas Abbott. After completing his CFL1 Trainer Course, he became a coach at Invoke. Since then, he has been coaching and competing for a couple years, trying to become a better coach each day. After graduating from college and moving back to Maryland, he was given the opportunity to coach at Titan CrossFit in Timonium, MD, where he learned even more about proper coaching, programming, and gym management from a fantastic group of people.", "Since starting BCCF, he has since moved on to live with his new bride, Shelby, who is in the Navy. Although he might not be in the gym physically, his influence is still felt throughout the culture and environment. Also, he loves to keep everyone in the loop with his weekly motivational BCCF email updates!"],
