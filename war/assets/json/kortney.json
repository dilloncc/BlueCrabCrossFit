	"favoriteThing" : "'I love crossfit because it is raising the bar- particularly with women. It's changing the way women view their bodies and what 'beautiful' is. (Strong is the new skinny) I love it because members bring their children and they get to see first hand the importance of fitness and it sets an awesome example for the younger generation. I love crossfit because it's becoming all inclusive. It's becoming somewhere you can go and get - not just a workout but nutrition plans, mobility and functional movement testing and in some cases there's even a clinic attached. It's completely altering the face of healthy living and public health.'",
