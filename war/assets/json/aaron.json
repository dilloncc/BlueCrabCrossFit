He moved to Maryland in 2012 to work at NASA as a Sr. Systems Administrator / Technical Director. His love for Health & Fitness is as strong as his passion for Technology. Aaron worked as a personal trainer while in College. When he moved to MD he was fed up with the 'Globo Gym' atmosphere and needed a change. He met Ben & Josh a few weeks prior to Blue Crab CF opening their doors and the rest is history."],
