				<h2>Rates/Pricing</h2>
				<!-- <h4>Yes, We ACTUALLY SHOW OUR PRICING. Unlike most CrossFit
								gyms that try to keep you from knowing the price- we have
								nothing to hide. In fact, while we are competitively priced, we
								can assure you that you will find EXTRA value in a membership at
								our facility! We are a gym designed to give DEDICATED people
								REAL results. If you aren't ready to put in the work, and have
								fun while doing it, then Blue Crab CrossFit is not for you. How
								bad do you want it?</h4> -->
				<p>No Price Creep Guarantee. Once you become a member, even if
					we increase our pricing, your rate will NEVER increase as long as
					you remain a member. Stick with us- and we will stick with you!</p>

				<h4>What does "Commitment" mean?</h4>
				<p>Commitment should not be confused with "contract"! Unlike
					many other gyms that force you to pay-out the rest of an unfilled
					contract, you will never have to pay for months that you do not
					attend! You only pay for the months that you attend, at whichever
					rate was appropriate for the amount of months that you "committed"
					to us. This offers a risk-free scenario for our members, and it
					rewards those who are willing to really become a part of the
					community!</p>
				<h4>What makes us different than other CrossFit gyms?</h4>
				<p>At Blue Crab CrossFit, we pride ourselves in bringing our
					athletes the highest quality coaching experience possible. From
					smaller class sizes (more 1-on-1 coaching), experienced staff,
					premium equipment, and complimentary nutrition consultations-we set
					ourselves apart from the competition!</p>
