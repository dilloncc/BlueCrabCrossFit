                        <li>How to plan, set, and achieve fitness and lifestyle goals</li>
                        <li>How simple lifestyle changes can give you a better, happier, more fulfilling life!</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>When is it?</h4>

                        nine classes over the course of two to four weeks. Then, you will be ready to join our group

                    <p>Anyone who is new to CrossFit will find Foundations an essential part of joining our gym. Don't
                        worry, no matter your fitness level Foundations will leave you feeling empowered and ready to

                    <h3>Membership Options:</h3>
                    <h4>All memberships (except for punch card) are unlimited, we
                        do not restrict the amount you can workout!</h4>

                    <p>12 month Commitment- $172/month</p>

                    <p>3 Month Commitment- $202/month</p>

                    <p>Month to Month- $222/month</p>

                    <p>Drop-in: $20. Contact us for multi-day
                        drop-in discounts.</p>

                    <p>10 Class Punch Card- $200 (only for experienced
                        CrossFitters) Must be used within 6 months.</p>

                    <p>Active Duty Military/ Law Enforcement/ First Responder/

                        memberships (except punch card) with valid ID.</p>
                    <h4>What does "Commitment" mean?</h4>

                    <p>Commitment should not be confused with "contract"! Unlike many other gyms that force you to
                        pay-out the rest of an unfilled contract, you will never have to pay for months that you do not
                        attend! You only pay for the months that you attend, at whichever rate was appropriate for the
                        amount of months that you "committed" to us. This offers a risk-free scenario for our members,
                        and it rewards those who are willing to really become a part of the community!</p>
                    <h4>What makes us different than other CrossFit gyms?</h4>

                    <p>At Blue Crab CrossFit, we pride ourselves in bringing our athletes the highest quality coaching
                        experience possible. From smaller class sizes (more 1-on-1 coaching), experienced staff, premium
                        equipment, and complimentary nutrition consultations-we set ourselves apart from the
                        competition!</p>

                    <h2>FAQs</h2>

                    <h3>Isn’t CrossFit only for people who are already in shape?</h3>

                    <p>NO! Due to a wonderful thing called “scalability”, we can
                        modify and tweak any workout to make sure it is a perfect fit for
                        your fitness level- no matter if you are a Great Grandmother or an
                        NFL Running Back.</p>

                    <h3>Isn’t CrossFit hard?</h3>

                    <p>Effort=results. If you want to improve your fitness without
                        putting forth any effort, chances are you will not see any
                        results. If you want to make real, measurable, changes to your
                        life- you will need to put forth the effort. That being said, we
                        make working out fun and exciting. No more running on the
                        treadmill for an hour while reading Harry Potter (even though
                        those books DO get exciting). This is real fitness for people who
                        are ready to put forth real effort!</p>

                    <h3>Isn’t it too expensive?</h3>

                    <p>Each time you walk into our gym for a class, you are taken
                        through a warm-up, workout, and cool-down by a professionally
                        trained CFL1 Trainer in a small-group setting. Many small-group
                        personal training facilities charge in excess of $50 AN HOUR. Not
                        to mention, we are writing the program for you! No more walking
                        into a gym and having no idea where to start. We teach, coach, and
                        encourage our members through every single workout.</p>

                    <h3>Can you get hurt doing CrossFit?</h3>

                    <p>You can get hurt in basically everything you do. Sitting in
                        a chair, climbing stairs, driving, throwing a baseball, etc.
                        CrossFit is no different. Although there are inherit risks to any
                        type of physical movement, your safety is our #1 concern. We
                        stress the importance of proper form, and make sure that we have
                        you moving safely and effectively in every single class you
                        attend.</p>

                    <h3>I’m a lady, will I get bulky?</h3>

                    <p>NO. Women bodybuilders do bodybuilding workouts. CrossFit is
                        not bodybuilding. If you want to lean out and achieve more
                        athletic muscle definition, then CrossFit will certainly help.
