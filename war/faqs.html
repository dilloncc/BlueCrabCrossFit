					<h2>FAQs</h2>
					<h3>Isn't CrossFit only for people who are already in shape?</h3>
					<p>NO! Due to a wonderful thing called "scalability", we can
						modify and tweak any workout to make sure it is a perfect fit for
						your fitness level- no matter if you are a Great Grandmother or an
						NFL Running Back.</p>

					<h3>Isn't CrossFit hard?</h3>
					<p>Effort=results. If you want to improve your fitness without
						putting forth any effort, chances are you will not see any
						results. If you want to make real, measurable, changes to your
						life- you will need to put forth the effort. That being said, we
						make working out fun and exciting. No more running on the
						treadmill for an hour while reading Harry Potter (even though
						those books DO get exciting). This is real fitness for people who
						are ready to put forth real effort!</p>

					<h3>Isn't it too expensive?</h3>
					<p>Each time you walk into our gym for a class, you are taken
						through a warm-up, workout, and cool-down by a professionally
						trained CFL1 Trainer in a small-group setting. Many small-group
						personal training facilities charge in excess of $50 AN HOUR. Not
						to mention, we are writing the program for you! No more walking
						into a gym and having no idea where to start. We teach, coach, and
						encourage our members through every single workout.</p>

					<h3>Can you get hurt doing CrossFit?</h3>
					<p>You can get hurt in basically everything you do. Sitting in
						a chair, climbing stairs, driving, throwing a baseball, etc.
						CrossFit is no different. Although there are inherit risks to any
						type of physical movement, your safety is our #1 concern. We
						stress the importance of proper form, and make sure that we have
						you moving safely and effectively in every single class you
						attend.</p>

					<h3>I'm a lady, will I get bulky?</h3>
					<p>NO. Women bodybuilders do bodybuilding workouts. CrossFit is
						not bodybuilding. If you want to lean out and achieve more
						athletic muscle definition, then CrossFit will certainly help.
						Please refer to the two articles below!</p>
