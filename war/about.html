										<h2>Ryan Farrall</h2>
										<p>Ryan was originally born in Seattle (Go Seahawks) but
											moved to Columbia at the age of 10. Ryan was first introduced
											to CrossFit during his junior year of high school when he
											joined the wrestling team. Turned out that the team's
											conditioning consisted solely of CrossFit. He fell in love.
											Since that day in 2011, Ryan has always done a little
											CrossFit here, or a little CrossFit there, but to his dismay,
											nothing terribly consistent. That is when he was given the
											chance to join the family here at Blue Crab CrossFit. He
											started training with Ben, Josh, Dallas, and Kortney months
											ago, and hasn't looked back yet. He continually looks forward
											to improving himself and those around him.</p>
