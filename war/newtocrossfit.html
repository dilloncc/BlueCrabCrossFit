				<h2>NEW TO CROSSFIT?</h2>
				<h3>What is the first step?</h3>
				<p>
					<span class="page-scroll">Click <a href="https://bluecrabcrossfit.leadpages.co/free-trial/" target="_blank">HERE</a>
						to schedule an intro session for free!
					</span>
				</p>

				<h3>What to bring?</h3>
				<p>Yourself, athletic clothes/shoes, and a water bottle (we have
					a drinking fountain). WE take care of the rest!</p>

				<h3>What is next?</h3>
				<p class="last">
					<span class="page-scroll">After the free intro session we
						will work to schedule your <a href="/#/gettingstarted/foundations">FOUNDATIONS</a>
						class. This is a 4-class program that introduces you to the
						CrossFit movements in small-group atmosphere. When you
						"graduate" you will be ready to start attending any normal
						CrossFit class! Everyone graduates, and no, there is not a final
						exam!
